Karvinen 2021: Install Debian on VirtualBox – Updated 2024
•	Explains how to install Debian Linux inside VirtualBox.
•	Steps: download Debian ISO, create a new virtual machine, set RAM, CPU, and disk space.
•	Shows how to add “Guest Additions” for better screen and clipboard.
•	Introduces the snapshot feature: you can save your system’s state and roll back later.
•	My thought: Snapshots are useful when experimenting, because I can undo mistakes.
Karvinen 2020: Command Line Basics Revisited
•	Basic Linux commands: cd to change folder, pwd to show where you are, ls to list files.
•	File commands: cp copy, mv move, rm delete.
•	Use pipes | to connect commands and redirection > to save output.
•	Use man to read manuals.
•	My thought: These basics are needed to solve hacking games and real tasks.

a) Can’t Fish – Disable Networking
Steps done:
•	First tested Internet with ping -c 4 1.1.1.1 and ping -c 4 8.8.8.8.
•	With Internet ON: system replied with times (ms).
•	With Internet OFF: system showed “Network unreachable” or 100% packet loss.
Analysis:
•	ping sends small packets to test connection.
•	Replies = Internet is working.
•	No replies = Internet is off.
•	ELI5: Ping is like saying “hello” to a neighbor; if they don’t answer, you are offline.

b) Local Only – Port Scan
Command used:
sudo nmap -A localhost
Result explained:
•	On a fresh Debian install, all 1000 common TCP ports are closed.
•	Nmap reported “All scanned ports are closed on localhost.”
Analysis:
•	Port scanning checks which doors ports are open on the computer.
•	Since no services are running, all doors are closed.
•	ELI5: Like knocking on house doors; nobody opens.

c) Daemon Scan – After Installing Apache
Steps done:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install apache2
sudo systemctl start apache2
sudo nmap -A localhost
Result explained:
•	After Apache was installed, port 80/tcp appeared open.
•	Service identified: Apache web server.
Analysis:
•	Installing a daemon means one port is now listening for connections.
•	Before: no open ports.
•	After: one door port 80 is unlocked.
•	ELI5: Before, all doors locked. After Apache, one door open for visitors.

d) OverTheWire –
•	Level 0 → 1: Read password with cat readme. Learned how to read a file.
•	Level 1 → 2: File name was -. Used cat ./- to read. Learned how to handle tricky names.
•	Level 2 → 3: File had spaces. Used quotes: cat "spaces in this filename". Learned about quotes.
•	Level 3 → 4: Password hidden in .hidden file. Used ls -a and cat .hidden. Learned about hidden files.
•	Level 4 → 5: Many files, only one was text. Used file and grep to find it. Learned how to find human-readable files.
Conclusion:
•	Learned basics of files, quoting, hidden files, and detecting file types.
•	ELI5: It felt like a small treasure hunt using simple commands.
