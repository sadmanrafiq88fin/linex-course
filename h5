Applied Cryptography: Chapter 1: Foundations
•	What is cryptography? 
It’s basically digital wizardry that locks up your data so only the chosen one can open it.
•	Golden rule: Don’t rely on secret tricks rely on secret keys. Even if the whole world knows your algorithm, your data is safe as long as the key stays hidden.
•	Why we use it: To keep secrets secret privacy, make sure people are who they claim to be authentication, and stop sneaky edits integrity.
•	Villains of the story (types of attacks):
Brute force: the smash every lock approach.
Math attacks: smart people with smarter equations.
 Protocol mistakes: the system around crypto fails, even if the math is solid.
•	Big idea: Cryptography isn’t magic by itself. It only works when combined with good systems and careful human use.

Karvinen 2023 – PGP: Send Encrypted and Signed Message 
•	What is PGP?
Think of it as sending your secrets in a box that only your friend’s private key can open.
•	The toolbox:
1.	Encryption – locks the box so only the receiver can read it.
2.	Signing – stamps the box with your unique signature, proving it’s really from you.
•	How it works with GnuPG (gpg):
1.	Make your key pair: gpg full-generate-key.
2.	Share your public key like handing out your padlock.
3.	Encrypt a file: gpg -e -r friend@example.com file.txt.
4.	Sign something: gpg -s file.txt.
5.	Verify: gpg --verify file.txt.gpg.
•	Why it rocks: No need to secretly pass around passwords. Just trade public keys and let the math do the heavy lifting.
