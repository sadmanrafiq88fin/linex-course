Should Tero wear a helmet?

Threat Modeling Manifesto (2020)
•	Four key questions: what are we working on, what can go wrong, what are we going to do, did we do enough?
•	Security must support business.
•	Not everything can be protected equally.
•	Idea: Seems heavy for small teams.

Shortest Threat Modeling Course (Shostack 2022)
•	12 short lessons.
•	Threat modeling  asking questions, not fancy tools.
•	Shows simple diagrams (data flow).
•	Idea: STRIDE is nice, but maybe ATT&CK is more modern.

OWASP Threat Modeling Cheat Sheet (2021)
•	Steps: define scope → find threats → prioritize → fix → validate.
•	Repeat often, not one-time.
•	Lists methods like STRIDE, PASTA, attack trees.
•	Idea: Could we do a mini threat model every sprint?

Darknet Diaries (Ep. 106 Xbox Underground)
•	Hackers got into gaming companies.
•	Motivation was fun and fame, not money.
•	Showed risks of privileged access.
•	Thought: Defenses shouldn’t assume money is the only reason to attack.

a) Security hygiene
For everyone:
•	Password manager, strong unique passwords.
•	2FA.
•	Keep devices updated.
•	Watch out for phishing.
•	Backups.
For companies:
•	Least privilege.
•	Patching process.
•	Monitoring + logs.
•	Security training.
•	Backup & incident plan.

b) Threat model – imaginary company
Company: QuickCart 
1 What are we working on?
•	Assets: customer data, orders, payments, uptime.
•	Customers use app, website, support chat.
2 What can go wrong?
•	STRIDE examples: fake logins, record tampering, data leaks, DoS, SQL injection.
•	Biggest risks: payment data leak, API downtime.
•	Attackers: ransomware gangs, criminals.
3 What are we going to do?
•	Mitigate: MFA, input checks, DDoS protection.
•	Eliminate: old endpoints.
•	Transfer: payment handled by provider.
•	Accept: small IoT risks.
4 Did we do enough?
•	Annual pentest, code reviews.
•	Update threat model often.
•	Monitor systems.
•	Security is never done, keep improving.
