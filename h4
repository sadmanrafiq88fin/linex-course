OWASP Top 10 (2021)
A01:2021 – Broken Access Control
Means people can get into things they should not.
Example: a normal user can see admin pages or another person’s files.
Fix: always check roles and permissions.
My thought: It’s like giving everyone the same key at school — suddenly anyone can open the principal’s office.
A05:2021 – Security Misconfiguration
Happens when settings are wrong or too open.
Example: default passwords, test pages left online, cloud storage left public.
Fix: remove defaults, close what you don’t use, follow best practice setups.
My thought: Easy mistakes here, like leaving the door open when you go out.
A06:2021 – Vulnerable and Outdated Components
Using old software with known problems.
Example: old version of a library that hackers already know how to break.
Fix: update often, know what parts your system uses.
My thought: Software is like milk, not wine it goes bad if you don’t check it.
A03:2021 – Injection
Bad input goes straight into a command.
Example: SQL injection lets someone change database queries.
Fix: use safe coding parameterized queries, filter inputs.
My thought: This is the “Little Bobby Tables” problem — funny comic, serious danger.
XKCD 327 – Exploits of a Mom
Joke: a mom names her kid with SQL code: Robert'); DROP TABLE Students;--.
If school’s database isn’t safe, it would delete everything.
Lesson: always check input before using it in code.
My thought: Funny but scary — shows why input must never be trusted.
